Cipher me that.

Cipher.

Scenario.
You are a White hat working for your govt. protecting a nuclear power plant or similar.

You are at your terminal, idly playing minesweeper, when you receive a message from one L337 H4X0R.

The message informs you that your system has been compromised, and invites you to play a game... 4 TEH LULZ.

Mechanic.

A series of predetermined strings (maybe randomly chosen from a dictions/library of common/amusing phrases) are simply enciphered and presented to the player. The object of the game is to guess the meaning of the string and type the completed phrase into your terminal(in browser).

The key will start as a single simple cipher and increase in complexity. Clues could be provided for harder ciphers. By decoding all the problems, you defeat the hacker and unlock the system. Some of the ciphers could themselves represent problems leading to other mini games.

Extra mechanics.
The goal is to prevent a disaster, so the obvious extra mechanic would be to set it against a timer. Quick fire rounds to win extra time.

Throughout the game, the L337 will message you asking stupid qs about what your favorite Linux distro is and telling you how they are actually Guy Fawkes.
